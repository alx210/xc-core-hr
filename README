This Xcursor theme contains 24 and 32 pixel pointer sets built upon the look of
X11 core cursors. These should work well with screens around 100 to 150 DPI.

Running ./build.sh [name] (name defaults to core-hr) will generate the cursor
theme directory, which then can be copied to wherever the host system wants
cursor themes to reside in (usually /usr/share/pixmaps or /usr/share/icons).

Finally, the Xcursor.theme resource must be set to the theme name and the
Xcursor.size to either 24 or 32.
